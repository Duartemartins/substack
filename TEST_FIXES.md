# Substack Ruby Gem Test Suite Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes that were made to resolve errors in the test suite.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Added `rake` gem to the development dependencies
   - Added `faraday` gem as a runtime dependency

2. **Syntax Errors**
   - Fixed nested `begin/rescue` blocks in `lib/substack_api/client/base.rb`
   - Removed duplicate test method in `test/client_test.rb`
   - Fixed extra `end` statement in `test/image_test.rb`

3. **Test Environment Setup**
   - Updated test fixture loading strategy to avoid method redefinition warnings
   - Modified test helpers to use proper mocking and stubbing techniques
   - Improved test fixture structure to separate concerns

4. **Mock Response Handling**
   - Enhanced mocks in `test_upload_image` to properly handle response processing
   - Added proper stubbing for the `handle_response` method

## Current Test Status

All 23 tests are now passing with 57 assertions:
- 3 tests in `ClientTest`
- 10 tests in `ApiTest`
- 4 tests in `PostTest`
- 3 tests in `ImageTest`
- 3 tests in `DocumentationTest`

No failures, errors, or skips are present in the test suite.

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding more thorough test coverage, particularly for edge cases and error handling
2. Ensure continuous integration is set up to run these tests automatically
3. Update documentation to reflect any API or implementation changes
